# KIP Guidelines

This meta-KIP will serve to document our goals and intentions when formalizing a KIP.

## Current Goals

  * Emulate BIP/ZIP structure, where if we implements a BIP or ZIP, it will have the same number
  * Totally new KIP numbers should not exist as BIPs or ZIPs
  * Brand new KIPs should use the 7xx or higher numbers
  * Porting existing BIPs/ZIPs should use the same numbering scheme
